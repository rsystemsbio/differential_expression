# seq_data

# These scripts aid in the processing of seq data from metagenomics and bulk RNA-seq data.
# Trimmomatic can be used for the cleaning of both
# The RNA Seq pipeline is Trimmomatic -> Kallisto -> Merge Reads -> DEG and Assesment
# The metagenomics pipelines is Trimmomatic -> BWA-Host Alignment -> SAM-Acquiring Unmapped Reads -> IDBA-Assembly -> Gene Prediction (TBD)
